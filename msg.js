Till you're knowledgeable and comfortable with the risks, stick to what you know/think is an acceptable amount of risk - PJ

<code>üìå Please understand posts here aren't investment advice.

üéØEveryone here is learning just as much as the next individual. Hence, rather than ask "what should i do about xyz?" It is helpful to perhaps share your thesis on a particular coin, explain your thoughts on why you would take a certain position (backed up with data, if possible) and then ask others for their opinions.

üí°we do our best to share knowledge with the people but can't win every time.

‚ö†Ô∏è Don't follow other people's trades blindly. You don't know their position size, time frame, stop loss, or exit strategy.

üîé Always DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH before investing.</code>

<code>üéì The basics of Income Tax is to be able to categorize each of your incomes into a tax category and then calculate your complete tax and pay it off. Because of lack of clarity on crypto income and therefore a lack of category, the best a CA can do is apply the closest category to it that s/he deems fit. This is what makes it subjective because one CA may interpret it differently from another. At the end of the day, you are personally responsible for whatever you declare in your filining. The CA is not. So you'll have to work with the CA to understand his/her interpretation and also assess the pros, cons, risks. Ofcourse, it is highly unlikely that your filing will come up for assessment unless you're making glaring faults. But incase it does, you should be aware about these things. - Demetrius </code>

<code> üí¨ Is Income from Crypto to Crypto taxable?

üîÅ Crypto to Crypto "should" be taxable, however firstly it should get recognition in law as being "goods" under sale of goods act / gst law or "services" under gst law but from what we know crypto is not officially recognised as goods/money and claiming taxes on c2c trades is not necessary.

üìñ For crypto to crypto transaction first the indirect tax laws apply (gst) and then on the gains income tax applies. Though income Tax is a more simple concept. In simple words, Any thing that gains in value through any action. That gains is taxable as increase in income, which is taxed. Though there are challenges whether it is Capital gains or business income or other sources income. But the main issue is whether each conversion of crypto to crypto is to be taxed under indirect Tax as well. For instance, you had 1 btc which you bought by cash, and after multiple conversions within cryptos, you reobtained 1.25btc and the liquidated it. That's taxable for sure. The issue is whether each crypto conversion is taxable or not. That's highly debatable. That's what US is doing.

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer : we're not tax experts and recommended connecting with a good CA for further understanding.
