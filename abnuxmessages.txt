's  highly resource intense activity.

   derived  meditation.exe  so intense   priority,  takes   processing power  leaves   none  everything else  much  possible.

  , action  needed,  inaction.  every success action  needed,  inaction.   ambitions, action  needed. So  whole ,   , has become focused   active .   active   going  create tensions;   going  create anguish, sadness.
Even if  achieve your goal,        achieved anything –  simply wasted your   your energy.
 active   your mind cannot     state  silence, relaxation, just  ease,  home.   impossible   active mind.
   inactive mind  can    home  rest ,   shelter,   beautiful feeling  nothing has   done;   are    are,   are   goal already, so    even   move.
  tensions are waiting   active side,  your desires are waiting   active side.  your ego  motivations   ego are waiting   active side.
 effort     bothered much  active mind  inactive mind, because basically  are mind.  active mind can   misery,   inactive mind can   what  Japanese  satori –  peaceful, silent, relaxed, contented feeling.   still remains    mind.    moved   mind  consciousness.   changed  focus,     become  focus.
So if  focus can  changed  inactive mind,  can  again changed  active mind.   no  –  has just  become loose.
 SLEEP SIMPLY GIVES  REST. REST  WHAT? REST   TOMORROW AGAIN.  WHY ARE  WORKING?    RESTFUL NIGHT.  WHOLE   , SO   NIGHT  CAN REST;   WHOLE NIGHT  REST, SO      CAN .    HOW  WHEEL   MIND GOES  MOVING:   ACTION  INACTION.
 was staying  Patna  1960   was suffering   migraine.  had suffered  migraine since  enlightenment;  had never suffered before.   migraine   only half   mind;    active    mind  has . If  active mind loses contact   inactive mind, then  goes  working   has no   rest.
Because  was staying   house   doctor...  was very concerned   was  terrible migraine,   was really very strong.  could  open  eyes,  was so painful.
 whole    simply lie down   wet towel around  head.   was   help – just  pass  ....   remained  me  twenty- days exactly when  came.   came  least four times  , so  was wasting too much .
 doctor gave me some sleeping pills.  said, ” least   night      sleep; otherwise  migraine continues twenty-four hours  .”
Usually  migraine does  continue  twenty-four hours; ordinarily migraine starts  sunrise  disappears  sunset, because   only   active .   drop out  activity,    starts cooling down   are preparing  sleep,  migraine disappears.
  was     me – migraine continued  twenty-four hours – so  said, ”  no harm  trying.”   really helped:  could sleep,  many years,    .  don’t actually  what  sleeping pills did chemically,     am certain  – which  chemist may  :  made  possible again   active mind   connected   inactive mind.
 REMAINED  WATCHER, something  me remained awake,  only   flame  awakening; otherwise everything went  sleep.  feeling was   sleeping pill helped    contact   non-active mind, which  had lost completely. Since then Devaraj has been trying again  again  stop  sleeping pills,   simply creates so much pain  so much trouble,  finally  torturing me once   month, then fifteen days,  again gets back   sleeping pill.   feeling     never succeed.  can torture me     wants – because  always listen.  whatever     listen ........
 was hoping  when  was  jail  America       ...  may  forgotten   sleeping pills.  was also thinking   jail   was    –  could    sleeping pill, so perhaps....   years before  had  slept;   those twelve days  DID  SLEEP  SINGLE WINK.
So here  tried   month  tortured me, because    only sleep   cannot ,   sleep  happening  stomach gets disturbed,  breathing gets disturbed,  eyes start burning.   don’t    any possibility... because without any device  shift  active mind  its energies   inactive mind,  simply moves   transcendental consciousness.  simply slips , bypasses  inactive mind.
So some effort  needed  become aware  these two sides   mind,  once   become aware  these two sides   mind, then without any effort, just watching these two sides,  sudden quantum leap happens. Your whole consciousness  centered beyond  mind;   beyondness  neither male nor female.
 was just  doctor who, feeling so much  me, said, ” whole   are  trouble so much;  least   night,    dose    sleep.”
  strange effect was   went  sleep    morning  was no migraine.  was also surprised.  was strange; these were only sleeping pills,  were  meant  migraine.   migraine  had taken  kinds  medicine – nothing helped.
 Buddhist bhikshu  Sri Lanka was brought  me because  had  slept  three years,   was going crazy;  head had become so heavy.  had tried everything,  nothing helped. Somebody gave them  address.  came   me  stayed  me  three months.
 told him, ”  stop vipassana” –  Buddhist meditation, which   finest  keep  aware. ”  stop     days.”
 then  inquired, ” what times   been doing vipassana?”
 said, ”  times.”   bhikshu has       –    doing any business,     any job.     has      begging once  ,   does   more than half  hour.  once    has    sermon – ’s     .
So  was doing vipassana even   night.   started doing  more when night came  sleep was  coming: ”Why waste ? –  more vipassana.”
 vipassana   method    allow  any sleep.   awareness,  if  continue   aware,  block  active mind  moving, diving   inactive mind.
So  told him, ”,  seven days  completely stop vipassana.”  just within seven days  was sleeping perfectly well.
Then  told him, ” can start vipassana  sunrise,     stop vipassana before sunset.  let us  what happens.”   worked perfectly well. Since then   been suggesting   people never   vipassana  night.
  enlightenment  cannot  anything.     question  your doing anything – before enlightenment  can change  doing something   doing something,  doing something only   certain period.   enlightenment  awareness  simply ,   remains  twenty-four hours  .
   well-known   Buddha slept only three hours  night   don’t   slept even three hours...  must  been resting.     possibility  might  been sleeping, because  whole   was traveling  foot.  was doing so much    body –  arduous   walking continuously  miles every   forty-two years.   possible   might  created  situation, even  enlightenment,  which  active mind was forced –   activity throughout  whole  –  connect   inactive mind.
   true  Mahavira.  slept very ,   was also walking continuously.
Most   enlightened people     died almost immediately  enlightenment –  shock  too much.  body may      , unless  body  specially prepared   .
Buddha  Mahavira were both trained warriors.  had very strong bodies –  bodies  fighters.  both became enlightened nearabout  age  forty,  remained alive  almost    again – forty  forty-two years.  can  only  reason   managed  absorb  shock:  bodies were so strong.   shock always leaves  body   very delicate condition,  most people  died just when  became enlightened.
Enlightenment  death almost came together.  became so awake, so full  light,    connections   mind   body were broken –  particularly if  enlightenment happened   age  thirty-five, when  starts declining.
 was never sick before  became enlightened;  was perfectly healthy.   enlightenment, suddenly  found   body had become so delicate  doing anything became impossible. Even going   walk –   was running before , four miles   morning, four miles   evening, running, jogging, swimming.  was doing  kinds  things.
  enlightenment, suddenly  very strangely,  body became absolutely weak.  could  believe ,  father’s sister’s family, who  was staying , could  believe .  was more   surprise  them because  knew nothing  enlightenment.
 suspected  was some connection   had no idea what had happened:  HAIRS   CHEST BECAME WHITE, JUST   NIGHT!   WAS TWENTY-!!
 could  hide  – because    hot country, India,   used  only    wrap-around lunghi  whole , so  chest was always naked. So everybody   house became aware    was wondering what had happened.  said, ” myself am wondering what has happened.”
 knew   body had certainly lost its stamina.  had become fragile,   lost  sleep completely.
 can understand    situation,  lost  resistance  diseases.  had never suffered  what   allergies.  loved perfume so much,   had never suffered because  .  always had flowers like champa,chameli , juhi – which are immensely full  fragrance around me   never suffered  any allergy.
  enlightenment  became so allergic  just  body-smell  somebody was enough   me  cold,  sneezes;   sneezes triggered something   chest.  started coughing,  coughing triggered another process;  started having asthma attacks which were absolutely unknown  me.  had never thought  these things  happen  me.
  was aware  what was happening.  consciousness   body had fallen apart;  connection became very loose.  body’s resting became impossible,  when    rested  many days, then  become vulnerable   kinds  infections.  are so tired,  cannot resist.  if  years  cannot  any rest, then naturally  lose  resistance.
Mahavira died – something was wrong   stomach.  six months  suffered very much  stomachache, no appetite,   died because   stomach.  may  been stomach cancer  something  which  was no idea   .
  said  Buddha died  food poisoning.  may     diagnosis   death.    certain,   must  had  very fragile body, which was very prone  becoming sick  any .       greatest kings, Bimbisar, offered Buddha   personal physician   continuously  him –   forty years  physician was  Buddha, twenty-four hours  , wherever  was going –  enough proof   was something going wrong. Otherwise, what was  need  having  personal physician?   too,   ordinary physician – Bimbisar’s  physician.
 if Buddha was healthy – because  scriptures don’t mention any illness....    forgotten   can  logically concluded  if  was  sick,  always prone  sickness, then why should  personal physician   emperor follow him  forty years unnecessarily?
 feeling   because enlightenment    lesson  ,   nothing more  learn,  are unnecessarily hanging around.   learnt  lesson –  was  purpose   – so  starts losing contact   .  most  these people  died immediately;  shock was so much.  death    calamity  them;    blessing, because   attained whatsoever  was  .
  live  enlightenment  really  difficult affair.  most      loses contact   inactive mind,   becomes impossible   any contact.  moment  are silent, immediately  energy moves  your transcendental awareness.  are aware, even when  are doing something, saying something.  flame    strong, because your energy  involved  some activity.  when  are  doing anything, then suddenly  whole energy immediately shifts   highest .   tremendously blissful,    ecstasy,  only  consciousness,    body.
